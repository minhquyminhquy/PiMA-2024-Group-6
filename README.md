# Interior Point Method - PiMA 2024 Summer Camp Report

## Overview

This repository contains the final report on the **Interior Point Method** developed during the PiMA 2024 Research Summer Camp. Our report focuses on exploring and applying the interior point method, particularly the primal-dual approach, for solving linear programming problems.
### About PiMA 
- PiMA is a non-profit project founded by Mathematics enthusiasts from some of the major universities in the world.
- We strive for assisting and mentoring students in Vietnam who are curious to learn about Mathematics and its applications.
