# Interior Point Method - PiMA 2024 Summer Camp Report

## Overview

This repository contains the final report on the **Interior Point Method** developed during the PiMA 2024 Summer Camp. Our report focuses on exploring and applying the interior point method, particularly the primal-dual approach, for solving linear programming problems.

### Key Topics Covered:
- Theoretical foundation of the Interior Point Method
- Algorithm design, including the **Barrier Problem** and **Central Path**
- Comparison with other optimization algorithms like the Simplex Method
- Practical applications, including a case study on the **Transportation Problem**
